    <h1>How To Go Outside</h1>
    <p>
        Tired of sitting home but you can't 
        to go Outside? You got lucky because
        today I'm gonna give you the extreme
        guide how to go outside and touch
        some <b>GRASS</b>.    Here are some options:
    </p>             
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>1.Play touch some grass simulator
                This game will help you start by
                knowing how that "outside" looks
                like and what will happen if you
                touch grass after such a long time
                </td>
                <hr>
            <td>2.If you are still aware and 
                scared of that "outside" you
                can try to practice looking
                outside in the window especially
                at the sunlight because sunlight
                sometimes can be scary because
                of how bright it is.
            </td>
            <hr>
            <td>3.!CRITICALL SITUATION!(very hard to execute)
                If you're still aware of that 
                "outside" you have to do the hardest
                thing to execute: Find a <u><m><b>friend</b></m></u>
                that experienced that "Outside"
                and ask him how scary or georgeous
                this "outside" actually is.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><b class="Joe-hack">LIFEHACK HOW TO GET A FRIEND THAT EXPERIENCED OUTSIDE.</b> So the best way to find that friend is to have a dream about
         that friend
        (if you know how sleep of course) or you can ask people in discord or reddit/twitter (they are the same and you definently have them)

    <p>And finally after trying all the attempts or only one you can surely go and explore that "outside". Personally outside for me isn't that 
        scary as many people think. 
    </p>
    <h5>THE END</h5>  Easter egg if you scroll down.
